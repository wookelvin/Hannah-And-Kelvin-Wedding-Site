            <p>Friendship continued growing after closing out our time as a leadership pair with the Taiwan team. Hannah felt called to rejoin CTI's Fulltime Program for a second year, while Kelvin had already committed himself to another year with CTI. We were placed on opposite teams for our second year: Kelvin with CTI 14:21 and Hannah with CTI 14:22. We travelled on opposite coasts, borders and even seas. This made our time of hanging out so sweet. There were always so many stories to be told after having toured for months at a time. Hangouts at Grizzly's and Dunn Bros were inevitable.</p><img src="img/img-postcti.png">

            <p>Now, Kelvin didn't want to mislead Hannah in any way. He shared a timeline with her, which of course made her blush, feel all the butterflies and smile a lot. He told her that if God would be gracious enough to continue blessing the relationship, long distance-dating phase wouldn't have to be forever. On October 27th, Kelvin secretly flew into Richmond, VA to prepare for the next day, the Proposal. On October 28th, Hannah woke up to a sweet surprise. Kelvin had snuck in and decorated the dining room with lights strung about, candles lit and a beautiful bouquet of Carnations. He sang and played his guitar and "wooed" Hannah down the stairs with a bouquet of balloons and flower petals. What Hannah didn't know was that Kelvin had shared this sweet moment with our families and some of our closest friends by live-streaming the entire proposal. By now, you should know that she said, "Yes!" </p><img src="img/img-ringbox.png">

            <p>Kelvin was finishing his first year with the CTI Fulltime Program as Hannah, already having completed a year with the CTI Fulltime Program, was finishing her Bachelor's of Science in Audio Engineering. </p>
            <p>We were introduced by Paul Vasilko and Chris Reed, the directors at CTI, via Google Hangout on April 22, 2014. The Staff at CTI Music Ministries had selected the two of us to co-lead a team of musicians to Taiwan for 6 weeks. Co-leading a team together gave us a greater understanding of how to work together and support each other. All the while, a sweet friendship was growing. </p><img src="img/Taiwan1.jpg">

            <p>By the time Summer 2015 came around, it was pretty clear that Kelvin and Hannah shared mutual feelings toward each other. We had our official "DTR" conversation at the local Caribou Coffee. We officially began dating on June 30th, 2015. Both of us were so excited, yet so anxious, for what the future would hold. Long distance was inevitable for us. Hannah transitioned into a Worship Coordinator position at a multi-site church in the Richmond, VA, area, while Kelvin continued to prepare and train the new CTI Fulltime team, later transitioning back to Toronto. As our lives quickly moved on, so did our feelings for each other. We have definitely made our fair share of efforts to visit each other. These efforts definitely yielded some sweet and memorable moments together. </p><img src="img/img-paulalyssa.png">

There was a lot of excitement, running around the house and Instagram photos to document all of the excitement as we finally had word that we could move forward with the wedding. As we continue to prepare for the wedding, there will be a few flights and goodbyes, but all that will change in August. Hannah will be driving up to Toronto, Ontario, on July 31st to help Kelvin move down to Richmond. He will move into our new place, getting everything settled until the wedding in September. After September 3rd, we will transition into our new life together in Richmond, as Hannah continues her work at PCC and Kelvin continues his work in Web Design/Development and Engineering. </p><img src="img/k1visa.png">
